Selector:-

    #id
    .class

    The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element (target by #), while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements(target by .).

    element selector:-
        Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color:
        p {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
            }

    Id Selector:-
        The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1": 

        #para1 {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }

    Class Selector:-
        In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

        .center {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }

    In this example only <p> elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

        p.center {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
        }

    Universal Selector:-

        * {
            text-align: center;
            color: blue;
            }

    Grouping Selector:-

        The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

            Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):

            h1 {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
            }

            h2 {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
            }

            p {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
            }

    Methods of CSS:-

        Inline CSS:-
                        Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, you’ll only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.
                        
        Internal CSS:-
                        Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add <style> tag in the <head> section of your HTML document.

        External CSS:-
                        With external CSS, you’ll link your web pages to an external .css file, which can be created by any text editor in your device
